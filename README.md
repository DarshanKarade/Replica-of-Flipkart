# Replica-of-Flipkart
Created a project replicating the Flipkart website using Angular. The project includes the following features:

View Products:
  Users can browse and view products fetched through an API.

Cart Functionality:
  Add products to the cart, Remove products from the cart.

This project focuses on basic e-commerce functionalities and serves as a good showcase of my Angular development skills.
